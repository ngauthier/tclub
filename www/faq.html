	<h1>About Taekwondo</h1>
	<div id="paddedText">
		<h3>Q: Why join this club,
and not the others?</h3>
<P>A:  For many many
reasons!  Some of which are: 
</P>
<P>1. Classes are free, so
it's like having a free fitness class. We believe in improving all
aspects of physical fitness, as well as the techniques of Taekwondo. 
Therefore, we train in flexibility, strength, and cardio in addition
to sparring and forms. Exercising with friends is a great way to keep
in shape and stave off stress! 
</P>

<P>2. It's a great way to
make new friends!  We have members in all sorts of majors, from BME's
to IR, that are more than happy to show you the ropes, or just share
some advice.  Some people think that a sport club is not worth the
time in terms of resume building, but we have had alumni attend Ivy
League medical and graduate schools!</P>

<P>3. You have the unique
opportunity to not only be a member and officer, but also to be a
future instructor!  It definitely shows leadership and commitment,
which most graduate or medical schools look for!  In addition,
student instructors are always on campus, know the problems
particular to the Hopkins student population, and are not committed
to teaching at any other schools which means they plan their lessons
with our specific club in mind!</P>

<h3>Q: What if I am not
athletic, or am very uncoordinated, or have no experience?</h3>
<P>A:  It doesn't matter
what level of physical fitness you're at, we welcome everybody to
learn, train, and improve with us! You will be pushed and challenged
no matter what skill level you are at.  We have members of all
different athletic backgrounds (from no sports to fencing to track)
and most students who join have had no prior martial arts experience
at all, but we all work up a sweat at practices!  
</P>

<h3>Q: Are you ITF or WTF?</h3>
<P>A: ITF</P>

<h3>Q: What is the
difference between ITF and WTF?</h3>
<P>A: The simplified
explanation is that ITF is more traditional and teaches Taekwondo as
a martial <I>art</I>.  WTF was founded more recently to focus on
Taekwondo as a martial <I>sport</I>, and train with the primary
purpose to enter Olympic style sparring (fighting matches)
competitions.  However, if you are new to Taekwondo, I would
recommend choosing a club or school based more on its instructors,
the quality of the classes, and the philosophy of the club. 
</P>

<h3>Q: Do I have to attend
every practice?</h3>
<P>A: No, but you do have
to go to a certain number of classes to be able to attend the belt
test, just so we know that you have mastered all the necessary
materials to pass.</P>

<h3>Q: Can I keep the belt
rank I already have?</h3>
<P>A:  If you are ranked
in the ITF system, then you can most likely keep your belt rank.  If
you were trained in WTF, you will probably still be able to keep your
belt rank, but you should email us or talk to our instructors after a
class to work some things out, since we do have some small
differences in forms that might need to be learned.  
</P>

<h3>Q: How often are belt
tests?</h3>
<P>A: Twice a semester, on
Sundays.</P>

<h3>Q: Do you do
competitions and performances?</h3>
<P>A: Yes, we do both.  If
you&lsquo;re interested, please let the instructors know.</P>

<h3>Q: Can I join anytime
during the year?</h3>
<P>A: Yes, we try our best
to welcome new members to the club, whenever they join.</P>

<h3>Q: Are there classes
over Intersession and the Summer?</h3>
<P>A: There usually are
classes, but they are optional, and there are no belt tests during
these time frames</P>

<h3>Q: I hear this club
is....is that true?</h3>
<P>A: Why not see for
yourself?  Most rumors about a club are not necessarily true, so we
welcome you to come to our demo, or drop in on any of our scheduled
classes to see what it's like for yourself!
