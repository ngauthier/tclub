			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>The oldest martial arts club at Johns Hopkins, Hopkins Taekwondo now celebrates its sixteenth year on campus. Following the original interpretation of the art (loosely ITF), Hopkins TKD seeks to enrich its students through understanding of the mental, physical, and philosophical aspects of this Korean martial art. We focus on both the traditional practice of martial arts, and optional competitions for any of our members to take part it, in both forms and sparring.</p>
			<p>Our Grandmaster is Tae Sun Kang, who is based in New York City. His website can be seen here: <a href="http://www.tkangtkd.com">http://www.tkangtkd.com</a></p>
			<p>Classes are free and no prior experience is necessary. If you are interested in joining us, please e-mail <strong>HopkinsTKD</strong> at jhu for more information!</p>
			<h2>About Taekwondo</h2>
			<p>Taekwondo is an amalgamation of Korean martial arts that have existed for thousands of years. One of the most prominent
			personalities of Taekwondo has been the originator of that name, Choi Hong Hi. Choi is a North Korean, who as a child was
			encouraged to study the old Korean techniques of Taekyun under the teacher Han Il Dong. As a student studying in Japan, he learned
			Karate over a period of two years, eventually attaining the rank of first dan black belt. This combination of Korean and Japanese
			knowledge was to form the basis of his teachings at the academy of martial arts he founded in 1953. The name of the academy was
			the Ohdo Kwan. This translated to "The School of My Way." At the time there were other academies in being, and in the process of
			formation. All taught Japanese influenced systems. The names of these academies are still to be found in South Korea.		</p>
			<p>
			As a professional soldier, Choi was able to introduce the teachings of his system to the men under his command. As time progressed
			he rose higher and higher in the military ranks, and was eventually promoted to general of the Korean army. Through his military
			liaison with foreign units, General Choi spread the knowledge of his system until it became international. In 1954 he became the
			established head of the Chongdo Kwan and sat on the board concerned with the development of a unified martial art development
			program. His suggestion of the name "Taekwondo," ("Hand/Foot Way") was enthusiastically received and applied as title for all the
			various Korean systems then in practice.		</p>
			<p>
			As Choi's system began to dominate in Korea, Choi was appointed President of the Korean Taekwondo Association, where he organized
			the first international demonstration tour. This tour led to the creation of the International Taekwondo Federation in 1966. Choi
			focused on the sporting aspects of the martial art, though it was much used in other areas such as military training. Through his
			efforts, Choi got sport Taekwondo accepted by the International Symposium of Military Sports.		</p>
			<p>
			Due to political turmoil in South Korea, Choi left the country to establish the ITF headquarters in Canada. With Choi out of the
			country, rival martial arts academies organized an international rival to the ITF, the World Taekwondo Federation. Since then,
			Taekwondo has not been a unified sport. As the WTF headquarters are in Korea, that nation has supported the development of WTF
			Taekwondo, which is less refined than the ITF style.		</p>
